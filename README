Libtext is stable, but under a beta release waiting to get user
feedback on possible improvements before the API is set in stone.
So don't depend on the current API being unchanged until a non-beta
package has been released. At this point please submit suggestions
on API improvements, possible additional features, or additional
convenience macros ( especially for t_newdef ).

You must have glibc 2.1 or a C99 compliant library, or parts of
Libtext will not function properly. If someone could explain how
to check for this in configure.in, it would be greatly appreciated.
At least how to check for glibc >= 2.1.

See text.h in the text directory for the complete documentation.

Libtext: What does it do?
==========================

- Creates, deletes, and performs operations on growable text / string
  buffer objects

- Insert, delete, append, prepend, find, and replace operations
  for strings and chars, optionally at specified positions

- Insert, delete, append, and prepend operations for printf
  style formats, optionally at specified positions

- Optionally execute a callback function on a predefined set of errors,
  either globally for all text objects, or execute specific callbacks
  for each individual text object

	- Errors for which callback is called if used:

		- Attempting to add a binary char

			- Binary chars are optionally not accepted by library

		- Memory allocation error

		- Exceeding optional setting of maximum length

			- Library will not add any chars over max length if set

		- Text searched for not found

	- Regardless of whether the callback system is used or not, a global
	  variable t_error will be set to a value indicating the error, or 0
	  if none

- And also performs many other actions on the text objects, see text/text.h for
  complete documentation
